# Python_project Least Squares Regression
The project is realised for Python_Programming year 3, semester 1. <br />
I used to make the project next library : matplotlib.pyplot. It was used for drawing the function graph, the points and the errors. <br />
I made three classes: <br />
1. Least_Squares_Regression
a. It has the function who calculate the new function. (y=mx+b) <br />
b. It calculates the new points used to calculate the error. <br />
c. It calculates the error for each point. <br />
2. Point : represents the coordinates of a point in a graph. <br />
3. Plot : draws the function graph, the points and the errors. <br />

Almost all methods are private because I wanted to call its in class, no outside (only the class can change its elements). Only what is needed for other classes is public. <br />
